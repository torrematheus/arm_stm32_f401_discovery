• LD1 COM:
LD1 default status is red. LD1 turns to green to indicate that communications are in
progress between the PC and the ST-LINK/V2.
• LD2 PWR:
The red LED indicates that the board is powered.
• User LD3:
The orange LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD13 of the STM32F401VCT6.
• User LD4:
The green LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD12 of the STM32F401VCT6.
• User LD5:
The red LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD14 of the STM32F401VCT6.
• User LD6:
The blue LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD15 of the STM32F401VCT6.
• USB LD7:
The green LED indicates when VBUS is present on CN5 and is connected to PA9 of
the STM32F401VCT6.
• USB LD8:
The red LED indicates an overcurrent from VBUS of CN5 and is connected to the I/O
PD5 of the STM32F401VCT6.


PD[15:0] -> GPIO PORT D

Memory Map
GPIO PORT D -> 0x4002 0C00 - 0x4002 0FFF 

bit_word_addr = bit_band_base + (byte_offset x 32) + (bit_number × 4)
where:
– bit_word_addr is the address of the word in the alias memory region that maps to
the targeted bit
– bit_band_base is the starting address of the alias region
– byte_offset is the number of the byte in the bit-band region that contains the
targeted bit
– bit_number is the bit position (0-7) of the targeted bit
